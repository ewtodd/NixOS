## NixOS Configs

This is a repo for the contents of my /etc/nixos, managed with flakes. It includes extensive use of home-manager to manage dotfiles - with a lovely rice using SwayFX. It also includes development environments for coding! It is designed to be used with two users, play/work, for separation of church and state. A home-manager level option called profile is defined so that the dotfiles can be setup according tto the appropriate account. The colorschemes for all apps are also set according to the profile option to ensure a different experience on the two accounts.
