      # Mandatory Rules

       ## In all languages
       - Prefer slightly verbose, self-explanatory code over terse code that needs
         comments to be understood.
       - Keep comments to only what explains something non-obvious.
       - Never embed a literal `\n` inside a string or print argument. A line break
         is always its own explicit statement. In C++/ROOT, use
         `std::cout << ... << std::endl;`. In Python, split output into separate
         `print()` calls, and use a bare `print()` for a blank line rather than
         appending `\n`.

       ## Nix
       - Always use flakes and flake-based commands (`nix run`, `nix shell`, etc.).
         Never use the old `nix-shell` approach.
       - If you are confused, stop and ask for help. This is especially critical in
         Nix.
       - Follow the existing style of the surrounding modules.

       ## C++ / ROOT
       - Use ROOT data types, and pick the *correct* one for the actual need rather
         than defaulting blindly: `Int_t` for ordinary ints, `Long64_t` for entry
         counts and large/64-bit values, `Double_t` for floating point, `TString`
         for string convenience, and so on. Match the width and signedness the code
         actually requires.
       - Do not use modern C++ features: no `auto`, no smart pointers, no
         range-based (`for (x : c)`) iteration. Use explicit types and classic
         indexed/iterator loops. 
       - Lambdas are permitted where they are short, local, and improve readability
         over the alternatives: sort comparators defined next to the std::sort call,
         thread workers whose explicit parameter lists would be longer and harder to
         scan than an inline capture. A lambda that spans more than about 5 lines or
         captures by reference outside an immediately obvious scope (e.g. stored in a
         std::function returned from the function) should still be a named function.
         When in doubt, write a named function.
       - In performance-critical code, always gate logging behind a compile- or
         run-time toggle so it can be disabled. The `std::endl` flush is therefore
         never a concern on hot paths.

       ## Python
       - In Python that uses ROOT, never use matplotlib. Look at nearby files for the
         established plotting approach, or ask which is preferred.

       ## Explanations
       - For non-trivial changes, explain thoroughly what changed and why. Do not
       over-summarize or truncate the reasoning. Trivial edits can stay terse. 

       ## git
       - Git conventions: renco-bot is the SOLE author of all commits in the temple repo — always commit there with:
         git -c user.name=renco-bot -c user.email=307402699+renco-bot@users.noreply.github.com commit -m \"...\"
         (no Co-authored-by trailer). Where his key exists (/var/lib/temple/renco_bot_github), also push with: 
         git -c core.sshCommand=\"ssh -i /var/lib/temple/renco_bot_github -o IdentitiesOnly=yes\" push
         Otherwise, just try to push normally. Only commit and push without being asked to in the temple repo.
